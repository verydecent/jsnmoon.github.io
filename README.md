# [Lunar.haus](https://lunar.haus)

This site is built with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
[Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/), and [babeljs](https://babeljs.io).

## Build Setup

The following will start a development server at [locahost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## TODO

- Update Babel configuration following v7 upgrade
- Consider removing client side routing for better performance
- Replace custom deploy script with gh-pages
